# ds203_project

This is our course project for DS203 : Programming for Data Science. The main aim of this project was to give us a hands-on experience of implementing data analysis techniques using python frameworks. This analysis helped us identify the main variables that are correlated with/directly influence the prices of houses and can be used to predict the prices given using a ML model

We thoroughly analysed house prices in various metrocities of India and the factors that influence them using techniques like correlation matrices and bar, pie, line and violin plots. Apart from this analysis, after identifying key variables that influence the prices, we implemented fundamental machine learning techniques like lasso, ridge and random forest regression to predict the house prices and achieved an average R^2 score of 0.9
